# turtlebot3_brownhall

This is a ROS package for navigation and simulation with Turtlebot3 in Brown Hall.


## custom world configuration

Clone a local copy of this package into `catkin_ws/src`


Export the proper environment variables


```
export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle_pi

export GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH=~/catkin_ws/src/turtlebot3_brownhall/lib:${GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH}
export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=~/catkin_ws/src/turtlebot3_brownhall/models:${GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH}
export GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH=~/catkin_ws/src/turtlebot3_brownhall/models:${GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH}
```

## use with teleop

Start the robot in a custom gazebo world with the following launch file.

```
roslaunch turtlebot3_brownhall turtlebot3_brownhall.launch
```

Test the robot with keyboard telop

```
roslaunch turtlebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch
```


## use with navigation
start the robot and simulation
```
roslaunch turtlebot3_brownhall turtlebot3_brownhall.launch

```

start navigation nodes, specify the map
```
roslaunch turtlebot3_navigation turtlebot3_navigation.launch map_file:='$(find turtlebot3_brownhall)/maps/bh3_map2.yaml'
```

send a list of goals
```
rosrun turtlebot3_brownhall publish_goallist

```

1. Update your linux system before you get started.
sudo apt-get update
2. Install the necessary nodes into your ROS system. This tutorial comes from here.
turtlebot3
sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-turtlebot3
turtlebot3_simulations
sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-turtlebot3-simulations
turtlebot3_gazebo
sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-turtlebot3-gazebo

3. Test the simulator. First set the environment variable TURTLEBOT_MODEL. Add
this line to the .bashrc script so you do not have to do it for each terminal.
export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
Then turn on the simulator.
roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch
You should see the gazebo window open containing your robot. Test that the keyboard
drives the robot. This may take some time.
roslaunch turtlebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch
4. Now turn on the node to produce robot data in the simulated world.
roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_simulation.launch
Open RVIZ to view the data. This is a very useful tool.
roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_gazebo_rviz.launch
5. Next we are going to learn about SLAM and GMAPPING ! Please see the tutorial
referenced above if you are ready to proceed.


## notes for making custom simulator world

TWH LOGS - 11/16/2019

    Goal: Run turtlebot3 with navigation in a simulated brown hall.

    So far I have the robot driving in a simulated brown hall with wall collisions working. Pretty Cool!

            1) Start with blueprint of the building from Dr. Canfield.

            2) Make a .stl from the blueprint of the 3rd floor using a CAD program of your choice. Joseph Owens did this part.

            3) Make a 'collada mesh' as a .dae file, this can be done with 'blender' software app or 'meshlab'. I used blender in ubuntu 18.04. 

                i) open blender
                ii) import .stl
                iii) export .dae

            4) Create a world file from scratch in the turtlebot3 package directory. 

                thill@t540p:~/t540p_ros/src/turtlebot3_control/worlds$ gedit bh3.world
                
                copy in the following code (http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=import_mesh&cat=build_robot)
                notice it mentioned the .dae file to load


                <?xml version="1.0"?>
                <sdf version="1.4">
                  <world name="default">
                    <include>
                      <uri>model://ground_plane</uri>
                    </include>
                    <include>
                      <uri>model://sun</uri>
                    </include>
                    <model name="my_mesh">
                      <pose>0 0 0  0 0 0</pose>
                      <static>true</static>
                      <link name="body">
                        <visual name="visual">
                          <geometry>
                            <mesh><uri>file://bh3.dae</uri></mesh>
                          </geometry>
                        </visual>
                      </link>
                    </model>
                  </world>
                </sdf>
                                

            5) Test the new world file. You should be in brown hall when gazebo opens. 

                thill@t540p:~/t540p_ros/src/turtlebot3_control/worlds$ gazebo bh3.world   

            That all worked just fine, but I do not think that is not exactly the way we are going to do it.


                     
            6) Instead creating a world from scratch, Bring turtlebot3_simulations into the workspace. We are going to create a new world inside of this package. We will use the already created worlds as a template.


               thill@t540p:~/t540p_ros/src$ git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_simulations.git
 

               Inside of this package I am going to create a new 'world' for turtlebot3 in live inside of Brown Hall


                i) collect the meshes that are going to be in the model, they should be collada meshes (.dae)

                ii) create a new .world file 

                    $ gedit /home/thill/t540p_ros/src/turtlebot3_simulations/turtlebot3_gazebo/worlds/turtlebot3_bh3.world

                    make the appropriate edit to the model name
                    
                    <!-- Load world -->
                    <include>
                      <uri>model://turtlebot3_bh3</uri>
                    </include>
                   
                iii) create a new model, this requires a new folder for the model

                    you will have to edit the files: model.config and model.sdf  

                    copy the .dae files into the sub folder /meshes 

                    these files will be referenced in the model.sdf file
                    

                    Here is the new model.config file.

                </sdf>
                __________________________________________________________________________________



                iv) create a new launch file to test this all 

                    $ gedit /home/thill/t540p_ros/src/turtlebot3_simulations/turtlebot3_gazebo/launch/turtlebot_bh3.launch  
        
                    you will have to edit the following line with the new world name

                    <arg name="world_name" value="$(find turtlebot3_gazebo)/worlds/turtlebot3_bh3.world"/>    

                    
           7)Now test! Launch this and the teleop drive and you should have a turtlebot3 in Brown hall that you can drive with the keyboard. The walls are there as objects and everything! The next thing is to try navigation but it should work no problem.
    
        $ roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_bh3.launch

        $ roslaunch turtlebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch
